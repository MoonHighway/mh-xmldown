This module will download a remote xml file and save the results as both xml and parsed json.  This module
is designed to be a tool for learning node js.  Students in Moon Highway ILT will develop and use this module
in their class projects.

Use

Invoking the grab function will download an XML file from a server.  Parse the XML to JSON, return the parsed JSON, and
save copies of both the xmlfile and the json file to the output folder.

```javascript
        var downloader = require("mh-xmldown");

        downloader.grab('http://www.xmlfiles.com/sample.xml', './output', function (err, data) {

            if (err) {
                throw err;    // Any errors
            }

            var jsonResults = data;   // The xml data results parsed as JSON

        });
```

Note
----
This module is an assignment for an introduction to node js class.  It is designed to be small and simple for learning.
It does not handle errors or work smart with options.
